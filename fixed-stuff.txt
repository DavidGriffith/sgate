Coffin room:

typos fixed.

The "half dozen" room description yet only five coffins is directly from
the original game.  This is one of those goofy constructs (like "it's a
hemp of rope") that I failed to catch.


Cold room:




Hot room:

Typos fixed.

After taking the torch and dying, the game still mentions pulling the
torch after the death message.  I can't seem to fix this.\


Cold room again:

when a torch burns out, it's called a "dead torch"


EPOR room:

I don't know how to make "take all" refer to stuff on a supporter.

"PUT noun IN SKELETON'S HAND" doesn't work, but I think most players can
figure out the other ways to do this.

It would be nice to be able to put the dragon blast message
AFTER the result of actions done in the Hot Room.

When the player returns to get the Staff of Ages, the troll could
probably be a bit more talkative rather that just plain pissed off.

Torches last 50 + random(7) moves.  Should this be changed?

Entrance
You are standing just south of the Castle Shadowgate. In front of you, to the
north, is a heavy wooden door set in the stone wall of the castle. A skull hangs
over the door.

>S
You have no idea what's out there. Besides, your job involves being inside the
castle.

>!!! SO, ARE THERE WALLS IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM HERE?

Hall
You stand in a long corridor. Huge stone archways line the entire hall. A large
wooden door covered with sheets of steel is at the north end of the hall. A
small closet is to the east. A beautifully woven rug is in the middle of the
room.

A huge pair of disembodied eyes appear high in the air above you, glaring
angrily. The booming voice of the Warlock Lord bursts forth from nowhere.

"That pitiful wizard Lakmir was a fool to send a buffoon like you to stop me.
You will surely regret it for the only thing here for you is a horrible death!"

The eyes fade away as if made of smoke. Maniacal laughter echos in your ears.


You can see two unlit torches here.

Hot Room
Fear grips you as you enter this hot room. This is a long north-south passage. A
pair of reptilian eyes peer out of the darkness beyond an archway at the north
end of the passage. A large wooden chest bound with iron stands against the east
wall.

You can see an unlit torch, a shield, a helmet, a bone, a hammer, a spear, a
dried skull and an iron-bound chest (which is closed) here.

Cold Room
You enter a cold room. The stench of flesh in decay pervades the chamber. You
begin to shiver. This room is really cold! In the north wall is a finely-crafted
wooden door. Next to it is a stone pedestal about waist height. In the wall,
between the door and pedestal is a small hole. In the northeast corner is a
small metal trap door.

The trap door is closed.

You can see an unlit torch, a shield, a helmet, a bone, a hammer, a spear, a

>CLOSE DOOR

WOOOOOSH!!!! A jet of flame shoots out from beyond the archway. Dragon flame
engulfs your body. You pay for your curiosity with your life.

You close the wooden door.


    *** You have died ***


It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or QUIT?

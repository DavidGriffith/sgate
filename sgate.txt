Hall
You stand in a long corridor. Huge stone archways line the entire hall. A large
wooden door covered with sheets of steel is at the north end of the hall. A
small closet is to the east. A beautifully woven rug is in the middle of the
room.

A huge pair of disembodied eyes appear high in the air above you, glaring
angrily. The booming voice of the Warlock Lord bursts forth from nowhere.

"That pitiful wizard Lakmir was a fool to send a buffoon like you to stop me.
Your will surely regret it for the only thing here for you is a horrible death!"

The eyes fade away as if made of smoke. Maniacal laughter echos in your ears.

Stone passage
This is an L-shaped stone passage which winds off to the east. To the south is
the entry hall. Set into the west wall is a small shelf.  Bits of stone are

The stones in these walls were probably cut by the hands of enslaved dwarves. 

There are four exits: north, south, east, and west.

rope and planks.

Mirror Room
This room full of mirrors reminds you of the elvish fun house at King Otto's

from which a rope about as thick as your wrist is sticking out.  A broom is
propped up against the wall.

"Listen, warrior! The Warlock Lord can only be defeated by thy courage and the
Staff of Ages. Remember, five to find. Three for the staff, one to be the key,

Hall
You stand in a long corridor. Huge stone archways line the entire hall. A large
wooden door covered with sheets of steel is at the north end of the hall. A
small closet is to the east. A beautifully woven rug is in the middle of the
room.

>n

Stone passage
This is an L-shaped stone passage which winds off to the east. To the south is
the entry hall. Set into the west wall is a small shelf.  Stones have fallen
away to reveal a secret passage leading north.

On the shelf are a candle (providing light) and an ancient tome (which is
empty).

You can see some stone blocks littering the passage here.

Arrow Room
Cold air rushes into this narrow chamber from an opening some ten feet above the
floor on the north wall.  A ledge projects from below the opening and is just
low enough for you to reach.

The secret door leading down and to the west is open.

You can also see an unlit torch here.

Two Bridges
You stand in a small cave roughly hewn at the edge of a deep chasm. From the
darkness below arise the screams of the undead. Two bridges, one leading west,
the other leading north, and lead to seperate passages. The one to the west is
made of stone. The other, to the north is a rickety suspension bridge made of
rope and planks.

EPOR room
This small stone chamber is lined on one side by a low barred portal. Above the
portal is a long shelf carved into the wall. To the right of the shelf is a sign
that reads "EPOR". There is a hole in the ceiling.  A thick rope hangs from the
hole.

>u

Mirror Room
This room full of mirrors reminds you of the elvish fun house at King Otto's
fair.  A puddle of green slime blocks the west exit.  In the floor is a hole
from which a rope about as thick as your wrist is sticking out..

>n

Fire Room
You are on a long, thin bridge which spans a floor covered in a thick, black
oil.

Chasm Bridge
You are standing on a sturdy wooden bridge that spans a deep, dark chasm. A
sharp, cold wind whips up over the ledge.

As you step forward, the troll reappears and blocks your path. He is holding the
spear you tried to kill him with.

"I have nothing more to say to you."

bridgeway leading from the ring to it. You can go back the way you came by going
south.

>sw

Gargoyle Room
A pair of stone beasts perched on the wall are guarding a dark archway to the
north. A small path leads northeast.

>n
Suddenly the beasts begin to shudder and their eyes begin to glow red. The
gargoyles, angered at your presence, spring from their frozen state and rip you
to pieces. There's not enough left of you to even feed the birds.


    *** You have died ***

>learn illumina
Using your best study habits, you commit the illumina spell to memory.

>illumina
Suddenly the cavern is so bright that you have to shade your eyes. It takes you
a few moments to regain your senses from the nova burst. It seems that the
gargoyles were also affected and haven't yet recovered from the spell.

>n

Well Room
This room seems to be made solely for the purpose of housing a well. An archway
leads south and a door leads west.

The well's wooden lid has been lifted.

>d
The swirling winds carry you down the deep well and set you gently into the
cavern below.

River Styx
You're standing on the bank of the River Styx. Its still waters support no life.

You can see a raft (on which is a spectral ferryman) and a gong here.

>get on raft
You climb aboard the tiny raft. The ferryman pushes off the shore. Soon you
reach the opposite bank.

Skull Gate
A stone skull stands against the west wall, screaming silently. For some reason,
you get the feeling you are standing on sacred ground. Three stone slabs hang on
the north wall. Above them are three symbols. The River Styx lies to the south.

The skull gate is closed.

>x orb
Aha! It's an orb made of silver. Its glowing surface causes your skin to tingle.

>put blade on staff
The golden spike slides smoothly onto the staff and locks into place.

>put orb on staff
Light cascades through the room as the staff becomes a living entity! The Staff
of Ages is now complete.

>blow horn
You can't usefully blow that.

>x horn
This horn is forged of flawless platinum. Its beauty is unbelievable.

>read dusty scroll
The scroll reads:

"Five to find, three are one.
One gives access, the bladed sun.
The silver orb, to banish below.
The Staff of Ages, to vanquish the foe.
Joining two, the golden blade.
The last to invoke, the platinum horn."

>invoke horn
That's not a verb I recognise.

>use horn
That's not a verb I recognise.

>wind horn
That's not a verb I recognise.

>light unlit torch with burning torch
(the unlit torch with the burning torch)
The torch burns brightly.

Your torch is flickering and sputtering.

Skull Gate
A stone skull stands against the west wall, screaming silently. For some reason,
you get the feeling you are standing on sacred ground. Three stone slabs hang on
the north wall. Above them are three symbols. The River Styx lies to the south.

The skull gate is closed.

Your torch is going out.

>wield staff
That's not a verb I recognise.

>use staff
That's not a verb I recognise.

>point staff at door
You can't see any such thing.

>point staff at middle slab
You look ridiculous pointing the Staff of Ages at the middle slab.

Your torch goes out with a fizzle.

>point staff at right slab
You look ridiculous pointing the Staff of Ages at the right slab.

>x right slab
It's a polished stone slab with a star-shaped niche cut out of it. A carving of
a jewel is above the niche.

>x middle slab
It's a polished stone slab with a star-shaped niche cut out of it. A carving of
a crown is above the niche.

>x skull
(the skull gate)
The jaw of the skull is made of polished stone and forms a door. Hot, dry air
emanates from the eye sockets and nose.

>put horn in skull
(the skull gate)
That can't contain things.

>enter jaw
You can't see any such thing.

>enter skull
(the skull gate)
You can't, since the skull gate is in the way.

>point staff at skull
(the skull gate)
You look ridiculous pointing the Staff of Ages at the skull gate.

>enter mouth
You can't see any such thing.

>play horn
The sound of the horn echos loudly in your ears. Suddenly, you hear the sound of
grinding rock. The jaw of the skull begins to descend. Hot wind erupts from the
mouth creating the illusion that the skull is alive.

>! spelling: should be 'echoes'

>! blow horn should probably work

>enter mouth
You can't see any such thing.

>enter gate

Warlock Cave
The cavern that you have entered is by far the largest your eyes have ever gazed
upon. A path and steps lined with flaming braziers leads to a stone platform
jutting out over an enormous pit.

>From the depths rises the most powerful creature that has ever existed: The
Behemoth! Your stomach knots up as you stare at this new horror. The beast is
indeed incredible. You wonder, for a moment, how you can defeat such a creature
as this.

The Warlock Lord is on a huge stone platform that extends into the pit. He
stands with his arms outstretched holding his staff aloft and facing the
Behemoth.

You can see the Behemoth and the Warlock Lord here.

>point staff at lord
The Warlock Lord feels your presence and knows that you are the seed that must
be destroyed. Flame shoots forth from his staff and engulfs your body. You have
failed!


    *** You have died ***


It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or QUIT?

Warlock Cave
[Previous turn undone.]

>point staff at behemoth

You pray, as you raise the Staff of Ages, that it has the power that the
prophets claimed.

The staff pulsates with power and a beam of light explodes from it striking the
behemoth. The creature screams in agony, thrashing back and forth in great pain!
In his rage, he grabs the Warlock Lord, and descends into the depths forever.
You can hear the Warlock Lord's screams fade into silence. Suddenly it is very
quiet.

A beautiful light seems to fill the cavern. "The morning sun," you say to
yourself, "It is over."

Although exhausted, you lean on the Staff of Ages and begin your long journey
home.

Word of your historic quest has already reached the farthest parts of the land!

You are triumphantly greeted as you enter the royal city of Stormhaven.

Moments later, you are ushered into the royal palace where you are greeted by
the King!

"I know what thou hast done, brave one. The world would be dark forever without
thee!"

You are bestowed a kingdom to rule and the king's fair daughter's hand!

As you leave the throne room, you know that although this quest is over, others
await.

After all, the bards will need new legends to sing of and new tales to tell!

The first story's end.



    *** You have won ***
